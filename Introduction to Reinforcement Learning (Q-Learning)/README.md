### **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)**  
I implemented a basic **Q-Learning agent** to solve the **FrozenLake** environment from **OpenAI Gym**. Q-Learning is a fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that helps agents learn optimal action policies by interacting with their environment.

### **How It Works**

1. **FrozenLake Environment**
   - The agent interacts with a **4x4 grid** where it needs to find the goal while avoiding holes.
   - The environment provides rewards (+1 for reaching the goal, 0 for moving on safe ground, -1 for falling into a hole).

2. **Q-Learning Algorithm**
   - The agent learns through **trial and error**, exploring and exploiting the environment.
   - It updates the Q-values (quality of action-state pairs) using the Q-learning equation:
   
         Q[s, a] = Q[s, a] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[s_next, :]) - Q[s, a])


3. **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**
   - The agent uses an **epsilon-greedy policy** to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

4. **Training**
   - The agent performs multiple episodes, learning the best actions to take in different states by updating its Q-table.
   - The training progress and success rate are tracked.

5. **Testing**
   - After training, the agent is tested in the same environment to check if it can successfully reach the goal.
