##  #100DaysOfAI

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge — a self-driven journey to dive deep into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** over the course of **100 consecutive days**. Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode challenge, this initiative is about **learning by building**, **exploring AI concepts hands-on**, and **sharing daily progress** to grow consisten

## What is #100DaysOfAI?

The **#100DaysOfAI** challenge is a personal commitment to dedicate time **every day for 100 days** to:

- Study key AI/ML/DL topics
- Build real-world projects or mini prototypes
- Share progress, code, insights, and learnings publicly
- Reinforce understanding by doing

Whether it’s training neural networks, understanding attention mechanisms, exploring NLP, or building projects like image captioning, chatbots, or recommendation systems — **every day is a step forward**.

---

###  Why This Challenge?

- To **master foundational and advanced AI concepts** by building.
- To **document and reflect** on learning through daily summaries.
- To develop a **strong AI portfolio** filled with practical projects.
- To foster **consistency, curiosity, and creativity**.
- To inspire and be inspired by the community.

### Daily Structure

Each day typically includes:

- **Topic/Concept**: What I explored that day
- **Hands-On Work**: Code implementation or project development
- **Technologies Used**: Tools and libraries I used
- **Learnings**: Key takeaways, struggles, and insights
